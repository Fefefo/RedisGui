# RedisGui
A really simple Redis Gui written in Kotlin

You need to create a file named "redis.csv" and write here the name of the servers and their url for example

My server1,redis://user:EfafwafAFaGawfawg1231fAF@redis-12345.cloud.server.com:12345
My second server,redis://user:EfafwafAFaGawfawg1231fAF@redis-67890.cloud.server2.com:67890
